TThe Penn Glee Club Band is an ensemble at the University of Pennsylvania that blends rock, ska, and swing into its own unique sound. The band was formed a few years ago as an integral part of the <a href="http://www.penngleeclub.com">Penn Glee Club</a>, a 152-year-old male singing group at Penn and the oldest continuously running collegiate glee club in the country! The Penn Glee Club Band, lovingly referred to as the PGCB, plays covers of popular songs, using its beefy horn section and three harmonizing vocalists to mesh classics and hits into our unique rock / ska / swing hybrid. <br /><br />
Book us if you have a banquet, reception, or other function that might require live music! We play jazz combo standards, classic rock hits, and contemporary pop/rock music, all with our own fresh twist.
