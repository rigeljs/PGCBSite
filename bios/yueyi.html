	<span id="bioboxa">A senior in Wharton, Yueyi is the third trumpeteer in our merry band. Ha, get it? Merry <i>band</i>. Anyways, Yueyi provides the PGCB with something it could not do without. And no, its not a female presence (though God knows it doesn't hurt). Its her signature blend of sexy, soaring, soulful trumpet playing that is impossible to miss. </span>
