	<span id="bioboxa">Tom is a Junior in the College studying Cognitive Science. He plays trumpet for the PGCB on a Marcinkiewicz Bobby Shew 1. Bring the hate. Despite being a Junior, Tom is a new member this year to the PGCB. Still, now that we have him, we don't know what we would do without his sexy, ball dropping trumpeteering. Oh and his trumpet is black, so thats pretty cool. </span>
