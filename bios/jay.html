	<span id="bioboxa">Jay is a freshman in the College. Also new to the band this year, Jay helps fill the PGCB's sound with his signature style whilst slappin' da bass. With big shoes to fill, Jay has certainly held his own thus far, and we look forward to his long, lucrative career with the PGCB. </span>
