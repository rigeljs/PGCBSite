	<span id="bioboxa">Max is a Junior in Engineering and Wharton. He plays the sax and arranges music. Every once in awhile, the PGCB will play one of his arrangements. In his third year with the PGCB, you can't help but take one look at Max and think: Kenny G (except without the hair - and really everything else except exceptional saxing). </span>
