The Penn Glee Club Band is an ensemble at the University of Pennsylvania that blends rock, ska, and swing into its own unique sound. The band was formed a few years ago as a counterpart to the Penn Glee Club, a 152-year-old male singing group at Penn. The group plays covers of popular songs, using its beefy horn section and three vocalists to mesh classics and hits into the aforementioned rock / ska / swing hybrid.

Book us if you have a banquet, reception, or other function that you could use live music for! We play jazz combo standards, classic rock hits, and contemporary music, all of which has a fresh twist to it.
